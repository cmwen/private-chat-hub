    Network Security Configuration
    
    This configuration defines the app's network security policy.
    By default, cleartext (HTTP) traffic is disabled for security.
    
    Development exceptions:
    - localhost: For local development servers
    - 10.0.2.2: Android emulator's host machine address
    
    For production, remove or restrict the debug-overrides section.

    <!-- 
        Base configuration: allow cleartext (HTTP) traffic.
        
        This app connects to user-configured self-hosted Ollama servers
        that typically run on LAN over HTTP. Blocking cleartext would
        prevent connections to any non-HTTPS server on a physical device.
        
        For production apps with fixed HTTPS endpoints, change this to false.
